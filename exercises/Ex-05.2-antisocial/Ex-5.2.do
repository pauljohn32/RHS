* flabbergasted Stata makes it so difficult to do this programatically



* 5.2.4 guessing x2 is pov ?


* See RHS p. 152, showing how the between and within slopes can
* be recovered by recoding thus:
foreach var of varlist anti pov momage female childage hispanic black momwork married {
    egen `var'_mn = mean(`var'), by(id)
}

foreach var of varlist anti pov momage female childage hispanic black momwork married {
    gen `var'_dev = `var' - `var'_mn
}
