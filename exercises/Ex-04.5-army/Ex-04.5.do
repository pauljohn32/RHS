xtset grp

xtsum

twoway scatter wbeing cohes if grp < 13, by(grp, compact)


foreach var of varlist cohes lead hrs wbeing{
    egen `var'_mn = mean(`var'), by(grp)
}

foreach var of varlist cohes lead hrs wbeing{
    gen `var'_dev = `var' - `var'_mn
}

* I wondered what xtsum means by "SD within", here's the answer:
* It is SD of group-mean centered data
sum cohes_dev


regress wbeing hrs
regress wbeing hrs cohes lead


* Between "be" lets get the between regression estimates, the easy and hard ways
xtreg wbeing hrs, be

egen pickone = tag(grp)
preserve
keep if pickone==1
sum
xtsum
regress wbeing_mn hrs_mn
estimates store be2
restore
