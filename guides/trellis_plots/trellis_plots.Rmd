abstract: In multi-level modeling, it is very common to subdivide
   the data into subgroups for the creation of graphs. The "trellis"
   plot, poineered by Wm. Cleveland, was first offered in S+. Since
   then, many programs have implemented functions to generate this
   same type of plot.

## Example data
   
The High School and Beyond data set summarizes mathematical
and English language achievement for students. I have instructions
about downloading and importing that data on this web page:

http://pj.freefaculty.org/guides/stat/DataSets/HSB/00-README.txt

The following will download a copy of the data if one is not
already available in the working directory.

```{r}
if (file.exists("hsb.rds")){
    hsb <- readRDS("hsb.rds")
} else {
    library(foreign)
    hsb.url <- "http://www.stata-press.com/data/mlmus3/hsb.dta"
    hsb <- read.dta(hsb.url)
    saveRDS(hsb, "hsb.rds")
}
hsb$schoolidf <- factor(hsb$schoolid)
```

## R packages for trellis plots

1 ```coplot``` in base R. Syntax: y ~ x | z, where z is the grouping variable.

```{r}
#coplot(mathach ~ ses | schoolidf, hsb)
```

Choose sample of 27 schools	
```{r}
#id27 <- sample(x = unique(hsb$schoolid), size = 27)
#hsbsub <- hsb[hsb$schoolid %in% id27, ] 
#coplot(mathach ~ ses | schoolidf, hsbsub)
```			   

Now "unused levels" in schoolidf must be dropped for purpose
	of analysis
	
```{r}
id27 <- sample(x = unique(hsb$schoolid), size = 27)
hsbsub <- hsb[hsb$schoolid %in% id27, ]
hsbsub$schoolidf <- factor(hsbsub$schoolidf)
coplot(mathach ~ ses | schoolidf, hsbsub)
```			   

2 ```lattice``` package

Fearing that usage of the name "trellis" might invite either confusion
or complaint from ATT, the early R facility to do same sort of graph
was named "lattice". Development work was done by U. Wisconsin Deepayan Sarkar,
who wrote a book about it named *Lattice: Multivariate Data Visualization
with R* (Springer, 2008).

The workhorse function for 2D plots is ```xyplot```. 
```{r}
library(lattice)
xyplot(mathach ~ ses | schoolidf, hsbsub)
xyplot(mathach ~ female | schoolidf, hsbsub)
```

The style of the presentation is patterned after the original 
ATT trellis graphs:

   1. School ID printed in small title box for each display
   2. default plot for numeric variables is a scatterplot
   3. Tightly placed subplots with no space between
   4. Re-use axes to avoid clutter

The design of the lattice function is intricate. It is possible to 
add features within each panel.

Like R base plots, xyplot will try to detect the variable types
being used and adjust accordingly.  Note the difference between
the xyplot using female as a numeric variable code 0 or 1

```{r}
xyplot(mathach ~ female | schoolidf, hsbsub)
```

and the xyplot in which the factor gender is used.


```{r}
hsbsub$gender <- factor(hsbsub$female, levels = c(0,1), labels = c("male", "female"))
xyplot(mathach ~ gender | schoolidf, hsbsub)
```

Please read the manual, ```?xyplot```. As one can see, there is a
very elaborate design that allows one to add detailed features within
each subplot. 

Over the past few years, several of our graduate students have
mastered lattice graphics.  I have to admit, I find it rather
difficult to wrap all of the required code into a single very large
function call.  That reluctance about ```lattice``` is somewhat 
widely shared, it was one of the motivations for development of
alternative plotting frameworks.  The leading alternative at the
current time is ```ggplot2```



3. ```ggplot2```

Like lattice, ggplot2 was a doctoral dissertation project. It was
Hadley Wickham's thesis project at Iowa State University. It is
discussed in his book, 

One of the themes is that people who make graphics should be guided by
a more formal, carefully elucidated framework.  Hence the reliance on
recommendations in the book, *The Grammar of Graphics*, from which the
"gg" in the package's title eminates.
	
The main difference between lattice and ggplot2 is in the style
with which individual plot pieces are added.

   * In lattice, one writes a single, large function call that
   adds all of the elements
   
   * ggplot2, like R base plots, allows one to add individual
   plot elements, one at a time.
   
The original ggplot syntax, to which I am still partial, resembles
object oriented programming. For example 

```
p <- ggplot(...code here...)
p <- p + ggplot_function(...more code here...)
p <- p + ggplot_function(...more code here...)
```

While that is my favorite way, the youngsters seem to prefer to 
write out the plot as a long sum of statements, like this:
```
p <- ggplot(...code here...)
     + ggplot_function(...more code here...)
     +  ggplot_function(...more code here...)
```


## Stata 

Stata is not my preferred graphics framework. I learned these
examples by studying Rabe-Hesketh & Skrondal's book, *Multilevel
and Longitudinal Modeling using Stata*.

The Stata framework for trellis graphics is rather closer to
the R lattice package than to base R graphics or ggplot2. One can
create an initial plot and then add features in parentheses after
that.

One interesting feature is that Stata uses the same basic command
to produce a plot for a single sample and for many subsamples.


### Explore twoway: Simple Scatterplot in Stata
   * Scatterplot
   
   Suppose we have columns y, x, and yhat (predicted values from regression).
   
#### twoay (line..) versus twoway (scatter...)
   
```
regress y x
predict yhat, xb
twoway (scatter y x)
```

   * Add a regression line
```
twoway (scatter y x)(line yhat x, sort)
```

   * Embellish with axis titles
```
twoway (scatter y x)(line yhat x, sort), ytitle(my y var is),
xtitle(my xvar is)
```

These examples work well if there is one sample, not separate
groups.  For multiple groups, we need the trellis graph


### Trellis

Suppose there is a grouping variable z

add a comma, then by  ```, by(z)```

I generally do not want the extra space that inserts, so by habit I
insert ```,by(z compact)```

```
twoway (scatter y x)(lfit y x, sort lpatt(solild)), ///
by(z, compact legend(off) cols(5)) ///
xtitle(whatever) ytitle(somethingelse) ysize(3) xsize(2)
```

### Examples to run for example

Illustration: 

1. Ex-03.3-growth

2. Ex-04.1 has subset example

3. The wheat yield data, RHS Ex-04.4




<!-- #### Create subsample of 27 groups -->

<!-- egen pickone = tag(schoolid) -->

<!-- See RHS p. 237 -->
<!-- format lwage* %9.0g -->
<!-- sort nr year -->
<!-- set seed 123123 -->
<!-- generate r = runiform() if year==1980 -->
<!-- * Choose 12 at random as follows -->
<!-- egen num = rank(r) if r < . -->
<!-- egen number = mean(num), by(nr) -->
<!-- twoway line lwage year if number<=12, by(nr, compact) ytitle(whatever) xtitle(whatever) xlabel( , angle(45)) -->

#### Spaghetti plot

egen mn_lwage = mean(lwage), by(year)
sort nr year
twoway (scatter lwage year, jitter(2) msym(0) msize(tiny)) ///
    (line lwage year if number <= 12, connect(ascending) ///
    lwidth(vthin) lpatt(solid)) ///
    (line mn_lwage year, sort lpatt(longdash)) if lwage >-2, ///
    ytitle(whatever) xtitle(whatever) ///
    legend(order( 2 "Individual" 3 "Mean"))
