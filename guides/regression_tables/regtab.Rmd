abstract: The most common recoding chore that comes with
    multilevel models is creating the group mean and individual
    deviations within group variables. This describes how that can be
    done with tools provided in the base of R, as well as in some
    addon packages.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
##This Invisible Chunk is required in all CRMDA documents
outdir <- paste0("tmpout")
if (!file.exists(outdir)) dir.create(outdir, recursive = TRUE)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo=TRUE, comment=NA, fig.path=paste0(outdir, "/p-"))
options(width = 70)
```

# This should be the workflow

1. Estimate models!

2. Write model results into files in the project folder. (I use a
   folder named output).
   
3. In your document, input the table file. Do not "copy and paste" the
table file into the document. Rather, insert a reference to the table
in your document. 

## Example data

The High School and Beyond data set summarizes mathematical
and English language achievement for students. I have instructions
about downloading and importing that data on this web page:

http://pj.freefaculty.org/guides/stat/DataSets/HSB/00-README.txt

The following will download a copy of the data if one is not
already available in the working directory.

```{r}
if (file.exists("hsb.rds")){
    hsb <- readRDS("hsb.rds")
} else {
    library(foreign)
    hsb.url <- "http://www.stata-press.com/data/mlmus3/hsb.dta"
    hsb <- read.dta(hsb.url)
    saveRDS(hsb, "hsb.rds")
}
```

```{r}
hsb$schoolidf <- factor(hsb$schoolid)
```

## R packages for table making

My notes about regression tables within R:

http://pj.freefaculty.org/guides/Rcourse/regression-tables-1/regression-tables-1.pdf

I'm partial to my package, rockchalk, and the function outreg, because 
it provides the minimal approach that is 1) certainly ready to show a 
class and 2) good enough for a convention paper and 3) close to being
good enough for a publication (but not extremely close). 

## Outreg example

```{r, results='tex'}
library(rockchalk)
odir <- "output/"
if(!file.exists(odir)) dir.create(odir, recursive=TRUE)
library(rockchalk)
m1 <- lm(mathach ~ female + minority + sector + ses, data = hsb)
summary(m1)
m1.o <- outreg(list("A Pooled Regression" = m1), type = "latex", tight = FALSE)
cat(m1.o, file = file.path(odir, "reg1.tex"))      
```

```{r, results='tex'}
m2 <- lm(mathach ~ female + minority + ses, data = hsb)
summary(m2)
varlabs <- c("female"="Female", "minority" = "Non-White", "sector" = "Public School", "ses" = "Socio-economic Status")
m2.o <- outreg(list("A Pooled Regression" = m1, "Fewer Predictors" = m2), type = "latex", tight = FALSE, varLabels = varlabs)
cat(m2.o, file = file.path(odir, "reg2.tex"))      
```


## Stata offers addons

The leading competitors in the Stata world are the packages outreg2
and estout. I've checked with my stata using friends. They say
both are nice, but estout is better.

To get started, read this:

1. UCLA FAQ
http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/stata/faq/estout.htm

2. Stata docs for the package
http://repec.org/bocode/e/estout/esttab.html

```
ssc install estout, replace
```

3. Other handy web pages

http://www.jwe.cc/2012/03/stata-latex-tables-estout


I did not add this into my stata example code, but will
have example here.

```{r sessionInfo, echo = FALSE}
sessionInfo()
```
