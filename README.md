Exercises and Notes about Rabe-Hesketh &amp; Skrondal Multilevel and Longitudinal Modeling Using Stata

I believe this two volume set is a very fine text for people that want to learn their way around 
Stata and multi-level regression.  I have found the exercises and data sets to be very helpful.
Like all books, there are some things one might like to change,
but, put together, it is a fantastic resource.

I'm sharing this material to my students, but I don't mind if other people
download the material as well. 

I still can't say I think Stata is an excellent program, I find its interface and sytax quite
frustrating. But I am making my best effort to learn and use it because we have many
faculty members who say they need help and the #1 request was to help with Stata
and multi-level modeling.
